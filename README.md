## Project Description

The Arduino pH-Controlled Pitcher Project is a TÜBİTAK 2204 High School Project that aims to create a simple but effective system for monitoring the pH levels of liquids, particularly emphasizing the pH of drinking water. The system consists of an Arduino board, a pH sensor, and an LCD display. The pH level is displayed on the screen, and the system provides feedback on the quality of the liquid based on its pH value.

## Materials Used

- Arduino UNO or similar Arduino board
- Gravity Analog pH Sensor Meter Kit [Product Link](https://store.arduino.cc/products/gravity-analog-ph-sensor-meter-kit)
- 16x2 character LCD display
- Jumper wires
- Pitcher

## Getting Started

To get started with this project, follow these steps:

1. Clone the project repository: `git clone https://github.com/YourUsername/Arduino-pH-Controlled-Pitcher.git`
2. Set up your Arduino development environment.
3. Connect the pH sensor to the Arduino board according to the provided schematics.
4. Upload the Arduino code from the repository to your board.
5. Connect the LCD display.
6. Fill the pitcher with the liquid to be tested.
7. Power on the system and start monitoring the pH value.

## Usage

- Make sure the system is properly set up and calibrated.
- Pour the liquid to be tested into the pitcher.
- The LCD display will show the pH value, and the system will provide feedback based on the pH level.
